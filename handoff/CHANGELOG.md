# Changelog

## 2026-10-06

- **What changed** — A client page lists people, notes, calls, open tasks, and a timeline. A finished file or a finished request on a linked space shows on that timeline. Staff can merge two clients.
- **Why** — Step 2 of the agency dashboard. The client record is the place to see what happened.
- **Code touchpoints** — `handoff/src/db/crm.ts`, `handoff/src/lib/store/uploads.ts`, `handoff/src/lib/notifications.ts`, `handoff/src/app/clients/`
- **Data-flow impact** — A completed upload writes `file_uploaded` when the space has a client. The first clean file on an open request writes `request_done`. Merge moves the other client's rows onto the one that stays, then closes the extra record.
- **API / schema impact** — none
- **Verification** — `npm test` (229 passed), `npm run lint`, and `npx tsc --noEmit` in `handoff/`. On `hq.localhost`, staff added a person, a note, a call, and a task, marked the task done, and merged a second client. The extra client left the list. The kept page said "These clients are now one."

## 2026-10-06

- **What changed** — Staff pages answer on `hq`. Client folders stay on the Handoff host. Old `/admin` links go to `/spaces`. Staff can add a client and link an existing space.
- **Why** — First step of the agency dashboard. One Worker, two hosts.
- **Code touchpoints** — `handoff/src/lib/host.ts`, `handoff/src/proxy.ts`, `handoff/src/db/crm.ts`, `handoff/migrations/0005_crm.sql`, `handoff/src/app/clients/`
- **Data-flow impact** — New CRM tables. A space can store `organization_id`. Only staff can read or write client rows.
- **API / schema impact** — Migration `0005_crm.sql`. Env `HANDOFF_HQ_HOST` and `HANDOFF_HQ_ORIGIN`. Custom domain `hq.abra-ca-dabra.app`.
- **Verification** — `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npx tsc --noEmit` in `handoff/`. Linking a space refreshes the client page so the linked space shows without a second visit.
